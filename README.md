- This was a team effort to analyze the Yelp dataset. We utilized **BigQuery** for data extraction and** Google Cloud** for data storage.
- We primarily analyzed the 6 states with the largest number of restaurants. Additionally, we examined the reviews of restaurants in each state and selected their categories from the top 10 most popular restaurants to create a word cloud. Decision-makers can make different decisions for different states based on how the top 10 most popular restaurants in each state operate and how they set up their establishments.
